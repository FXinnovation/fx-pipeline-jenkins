The *dockerRunCommand* function is a helper to get a complete docker run command or a fallback command if docker is not available.

It will generate a valid docker run command containing additional mounts and environment variables.
If docker is not available in the context this function is called, this function will return the fallbackCommand passed as parameter.

If docker is available, this function will also pull the dockerImage passed as parameter preventively.

**Usage**
```
  command = dockerRunCommand(
    dockerImage: String,
    fallbackCommand: String,
    additionalMounts: Map,
    environmentVariables: Map,
  )
```
