The *dockerRun* method is a helper to get a docker run command or a fallback command if docker is not available.

It will generate a valid docker run command containing additional mounts and environment variables.
If docker is not available in the context this function is called, this function will return the fallbackCommand passed as parameter.

**Usage**
```
  command = dockerRunCommand(
    dockerImage: String,
    fallbackCommand: String,
    additionalMounts: Map,
    environmentVariables: Map,
  )
```
