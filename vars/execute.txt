The *execute* method is a helper to execute a shell command.

It will execute your shell script while capturing stdout, stderr and the satuscode, but still displaying these on the console. It will also return a map containing stdout, stderr and the status code.

*NOTE:The command will be executed with the pipefail option activated!*

**Usage**
```
  execution = execute(
    script: String,
    thorwError: Boolean, // Defaults to true
  )
  println execution.stdout
  println execution.stderr
  println execution.statusCode
```
